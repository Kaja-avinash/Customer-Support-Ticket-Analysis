# Customer Support Ticket Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer support tickets using data visualization, sentiment analysis, and text mining. By leveraging NLP techniques and interactive dashboards, the project helps organizations gain insights into customer satisfaction, ticket trends, and the effectiveness of support teams.

## üìå Overview
This analysis helps businesses:
- Understand the distribution of ticket types, priorities, and channels.
- Analyze customer sentiment and satisfaction.
- Identify common issues through bigrams (word pairs).
- Track the time-to-resolution and first-response metrics.
- Generate actionable insights and recommendations for improving customer support.

## üéØ Key Objectives
‚úî **Ticket Distribution**: Analyze the distribution of ticket types, priorities, and channels.  
‚úî **Sentiment Analysis**: Categorize customer sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.  
‚úî **Ticket Resolution**: Assess the average and median resolution time.  
‚úî **Customer Satisfaction**: Understand satisfaction levels across ticket types and priorities.  
‚úî **Text Analysis**: Identify common issues through text analysis (bigrams, word count).  
‚úî **Visualize Insights**: Present findings through interactive and informative visualizations.

## üõ† Tools & Technologies
### Python Libraries:
- **pandas, numpy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **nltk**: Sentiment analysis, text tokenization, lemmatization.
- **matplotlib, seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **textblob**: Sentiment analysis.
- **openpyxl**: Excel file manipulation for reports.
  
### APIs & Data:
- **Customer Support Ticket Data**: Import customer support ticket data (CSV format) for analysis.

## üìä Approach
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Cleaning
- **Load data** from a CSV file containing customer support ticket information.
- **Preprocess the data** by filling missing values and converting relevant columns to numerical data types.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sentiment Analysis
- **TextBlob**: Calculate sentiment polarity for each ticket description.
- Classify sentiment into three categories: Positive, Negative, Neutral.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Text Analysis
- **Tokenization**: Split text into tokens (words).
- **Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base forms.
- **Bigram and Trigram Generation**: Identify word pairs and triplets for common issue detection.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization & Insights
Generate multiple charts to visualize the insights:
- **Ticket Type Distribution**: Bar chart showing ticket type percentages.
- **Ticket Priority Distribution**: Pie chart for ticket priority distribution.
- **Sentiment Distribution**: Bar chart displaying sentiment distribution (Positive, Neutral, Negative).
- **Top 5 Common Bigrams**: Identify the most frequent bigrams in ticket descriptions.
- **Resolution Time and Satisfaction Metrics**: Track resolution time and customer satisfaction by ticket type.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Reporting
Generate a comprehensive report with key metrics:
- **Key Metrics**: Total tickets, average resolution time, customer satisfaction, SLA compliance.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Sentiment distribution, sentiment by ticket type.
- **Common Issues**: Display top bigrams.
- **Recommendations**: Provide recommendations based on sentiment analysis and other metrics.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Excel Export
Export insights and visualizations to an Excel file for easy sharing and further analysis.

## üß© Business Applications
- **Brand Monitoring**: Track sentiment about your products/services.
- **Competitor Analysis**: Compare ticket trends and sentiment with competitors.
- **Marketing Strategy**: Optimize customer support processes based on insights.
- **Crisis Management**: Detect negative sentiment early and take corrective actions.

## üîÆ Future Improvements
- **Real-time Analysis**: Stream ticket data for real-time analysis using APIs like Twitter Streaming API.
- **Advanced NLP Models**: Use models like BERT for deeper sentiment understanding.
- **Competitor Benchmarking**: Compare multiple brands simultaneously.
- **Automated Alerts**: Detect sudden sentiment shifts and trigger notifications.
